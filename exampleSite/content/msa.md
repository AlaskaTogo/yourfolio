    description: Designing a system that has different configurations. As a team we decided to go with motorcycle shock absorbers. For the first configuration we decided to have a coil-over design lets the user adjust the height of the springs and potentially increase the performance of the shock although depending on how the user tunes the shocks the ride can stiffer, making it a less comfortable ride. For the second configuration we decided on a double spring design can improve the ride by having two springs absorb the vibrations from the road increasing the stability of the ride, but these shocks cannot be adjusted like the coil-over design.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GsnlIKA"><a href="https://imgur.com/GsnlIKA">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="NbVzim2"><a href="https://imgur.com/NbVzim2">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="5NNghz7"><a href="https://imgur.com/5NNghz7">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="uRYfgSs"><a href="https://imgur.com/uRYfgSs">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The suspension system must be able to sustain the weight of the motorcycle as well as the weight of the user. Such that when the system is compressed it has tot eh ability to return its natural /neutral position.<br>The engineering principle that was applied to the design of our shock absorber is from mechanical vibrations. The concept of a mass-spring-damper system since it is the fundamental concept of our system.<br>Since everything life has a natural frequency, we had to consider it when designing the shock absorber.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="XByl8xx"><a href="https://imgur.com/XByl8xx">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>In the figure above, the amplitude of the system with a damper is exponentially decreasing i.e., controlled better compared to the system without the damper over the same duration of time.<br>A thing to consider when calculating the natural frequency is the understanding the concept of resonance. Resonance occurs when the frequency of applied force matches the natural frequency of the object’s vibration and causing an increase in the frequency.<br>Therefore, the system could fail.Examples of resonance are the Tacoma Bridge or an opera singer who could shatter a wine glass with their voice’s acoustic vibration.<br>Damping is the way a system naturally dissipates energy and exerts through heat. When a system is underdamped, it oscillates causing a high frequency. For overdamped system is usually not an ideal system because it could have a slow reaction. But there are times where overdamped systems are useful, an anti-slamming door or an elevator. Ideal system would be having a damping ratio of zero which is known to be critically damped because it would response faster than an overdamped system and would stabilize faster than an underdamped system.<br>Mathematically calculated the overall system with Newton’s 2nd law to prove if the system was feasible. Our design did fulfill our expectations.<p>Learning outcome:learned to plan accordingly and managed time for each individual. As well, the importance of designing a system with vibration in mind before the aesthetics of it.</p>
