    description: The objective of this project is to design a system that has different configurations. As a team, we decided to go with motorcycle shock absorbers. For the first configuration, we decided to have a coil-over design that lets the user adjust the height of the springs and potentially increase the shock's performance, although depending on how the user tunes the shocks, the ride can get stiffer, making it less comfortable ride. In the second configuration, we decided on a double spring design that can improve the ride by having two springs absorb the vibrations caused by the road, increasing the ride's stability, but the second configuration shocks springs are not adjustable. <br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GsnlIKA"><a href="https://imgur.com/GsnlIKA">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="NbVzim2"><a href="https://imgur.com/NbVzim2">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="5NNghz7"><a href="https://imgur.com/5NNghz7">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="uRYfgSs"><a href="https://imgur.com/uRYfgSs">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The suspension system must sustain the weight of the motorcycle and the weight of the user. Such that when the suspension system is compressed, it can return to its natural /neutral position.<br>The engineering application of this design for both of the shock absorbers is from mechanical vibrations. The application is related to the general mass-spring-damper system since it is the fundamental concept of our system.<br>Since everything life has a natural frequency, we had to consider it when designing the shock absorber.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="XByl8xx"><a href="https://imgur.com/XByl8xx">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>In the figure above, the system's amplitude with a damper is exponentially decreasing, i.e., controlled better than the system without the damper over the same duration of time.<br>A thing to consider when calculating the natural frequency is understanding the concept of resonance. Resonance occurs when the frequency of applied force matches the natural frequency of the object's vibration and causing an increase in the frequency.<br>Therefore, the system could fail. Examples of resonance are the Tacoma Bridge or an opera singer who could shatter a wine glass with their voice's acoustic vibration.<br>Damping is the way a system naturally dissipates energy by exerting heat. When a system is underdamped, it oscillates causing a high frequency. An overdamped system is usually not an ideal system because it could have a slow reaction. But there are times where overdamped systems are useful, an anti-slamming door or an elevator. The ideal system would have a damping ratio of zero known to be critically damped because it would respond faster than an overdamped system and stabilize more quickly than an underdamped system.<br>We have mathematically calculated the overall system with Newton's 2nd law to prove if the system was feasible. Our design did fulfill our expectations.<p>Learning outcomes - learned to plan accordingly and managed time for each individual. As well, the importance of designing a system with vibration in mind before the aesthetics of it.</p>
