    description: I joined CSUF’s <a href="https://titanrover.com/">Titan Rover</a> team in May of 2019. The team being a multidisciplinary group of students because of the rover's necessary features and potentially having a chance to learn from different majors' specialty is what drew me into joining the team. Annually, CSUF Titan Rover participates in an international competition, the University Rover Challenge, located in Hanksville, Utah, where universities worldwide compete. Thankfully, I had the chance to compete in the 2019 competition before the covid-19 virus circulated the world. The experience I gained from the competition motivated me more to stay with this team.<br>I was assigned to the robotics sub-team for my senior year, which focuses on the robotic arm and the end effector (gripper) of the rover - KRONOS. Initially, the team decided to design a new gripper. After discussing the logistics of the tasks and time needed, we came to terms to tune up the previous rover's end effector. My task was to improve the gripper used in last year's team's and design a system that can perform the necessary task. The task is to allow the rover to perform high precision tasks – type commands on a keyboard during the equipment servicing mission on a service lander and screw in/out a bolt. Although this task could be performed with the end effector, the risk of having an error is higher because the end effector cannot mimic a typing motion, and the operator could accidentally drop the Allen key tool while in use. The end effector's rotation has not been functioning properly. Designing a system that does not need the end effector rotation eliminates that issue temporally for this task. Therefore, to mitigate having too many systems running through the robotic arm's platform and making it easier for the controls sub-team to operate the rover – I came up with a general concept of designing the system shown below. <br> <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="cjtyGgf"><a href="https://imgur.com/cjtyGgf">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <br> The system's attributes are to have an Allen key coupled to the shaft of a motor with high torque output and having it rest on a ball bearing to make it easier for the push-pull solenoid's shaft (that is coupled to the motor) to translate. A linear actuator can then extend or retract the solenoid and motor assembly past the end effector to prevent interference. Therefore, we could use the Allen key to type on the keyboard, also having the functionality of unscrewing the hex head bolt. Below are pictures of testing the integrated typing/Allen key tool system being a success.<br> <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="h71IX0Y"><a href="https://imgur.com/h71IX0Y">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GOZt9H4"><a href="https://imgur.com/GOZt9H4">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <br> <br>The main issue of the end effector was the rotation at the wrist. It would rotate, but it stops at a certain point, then gets stuck at a certain position, and the gap between the end effector and the link it is coupled to would slightly oscillate. As a team, it was determined that was the root cause of both of the problems. To control that as team, we decided the best way to handle this to avoid a whole redesign of the end effector is to add an idle gear on the opposite end of the pinion gear that was rotating the end effector. Below are photos of the subassembly (yes, there were two external retaining rings on each side of the rod to prevent the rod from rotating) and the rod with the idle gear and a bearing before the rod is about to get cut to the ideal length.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="wezU5S4"><a href="https://imgur.com/wezU5S4">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="3OdLAS4"><a href="https://imgur.com/3OdLAS4">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>Unfortunately, this did not get the chance to get tested because of the pandemic lockdown. <p>Learning outcomes are design methods for manufacturing, time-management for testing and tuning, team communication skills, and soldering.</p>
