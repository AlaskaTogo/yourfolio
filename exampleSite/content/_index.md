    description: A recent graduate from <a href="https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/me/">California State University, Fullerton</a>. I have always been intrigued by how objects function and having an artistic background, eventually led me to study mechanical engineering.<br>I currently spend most of my days maintaining and repairing my cars as needed when I am not spending time with my nieceâ€”spending almost every weekend at the junkyard to find reusable parts. Swapping old parts out or performing essential maintenance has a person gain a great learning experience.<br>I appreciate applying theoretical concepts that I have learned from my studies and fixing things. Since I'm a lifelong learner, I also enjoy traveling to learn about different cultures. I hope one day I'll be able to give back to my community. <br> <p><a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:c7a1513b-277d-4c49-90f5-e219edd40ef4">Resume.pdf</a></p>
