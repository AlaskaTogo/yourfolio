    description: A recent graduate from <a href="https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/me/">California State University, Fullerton</a>. I have always been intrigued by how objects function and having an artistic background, eventually led me to study mechanical engineering.<br>Currently, I am restoring a 2002 Acura RSX Type-S from the mid-west and a 2006 Honda Accord LX from sunny California when I am not spending time with my niece—spending almost every weekend at the junkyard to find reusable parts. Swapping old parts out or performing essential maintenance has a person gain a great learning experience.<br>For example, some of the 2006 Honda Accord's windshield wipers are known to overshoot when in use, so they either slam at the bottom of the windshield when returning to resting position or slam into the driver's side windshield frame. This is either caused by the gears inside the windshield wiper's motor are worn out, or the linkages bushings are breaking off. This Accord happened to a lucky winner of having one these issues – the bushing broke off. Having to remove the old windshield linkages, you can see the four-bar linkage system design is used for the functionality of vehicle windshield wipers.<br>I appreciate applying theoretical concepts that I have learned from my studies and fixing things. Since I'm a lifelong learner, I also enjoy traveling to learn about different cultures. I hope one day I'll be able to give back to my community. <br> <p><a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:c7a1513b-277d-4c49-90f5-e219edd40ef4">Resume.pdf</a></p>
