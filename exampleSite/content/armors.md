    description: In the 2020 spring semester, I wanted to apply my theoretical knowledge of control systems, and I joined a graduate student, Nguyen Truong's research – ARMORS, which stands for Automatic Response Man-Overboard Rescue System. Man-overboard scenarios are among the leading causes of death in deep-sea fishing, one of the United States' most dangerous occupations. To improve rescue efficiency, ARMORS was introduced. ARMORS consists of unmanned lifeboat units (Smart Rafts) that automatically deploy and approach the fallen person, significantly reducing rescue time and enhancing the worker's survivability. According to a control scheme, the Smart Raft navigates to the fallen person and back to the main ship, which is to be developed by Nguyen Truong. This control scheme specifies the necessary linear acceleration of the Smart Raft at any given time. The challenge is to translate the Smart Raft kinematics into the required kinematics of the Smart Raft's propellers. I was assigned to develop a mathematical model that relates the kinetics of the propellers to the kinematics of the Smart Raft. This work was separate and distinct from the control scheme itself.<br>When modeling a control system, it is essential to understand the system's mechanics before setting up the control schematics. The focus is on the unmanned lifeboat's geometry and environmental condition it is in for this system. For analysis purposes, the environment will be in calm water with no shear wind forces applied to the lifeboat body. The figure shown below is the design of the lifeboat via Solidworks by Nguyen Truong. Although it is not displayed in this figure – there will be two parallel propellers underneath the lifeboat to help navigate.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="oJBfnZ5"><a href="https://imgur.com/oJBfnZ5">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The following is a free body diagram of the smart raft.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="IgZlOBU"><a href="https://imgur.com/IgZlOBU">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Learning outcomes are after understanding having a tracking algorithm and a breakdown of the system's dynamics. Therefore able to control the system's dynamics to the path constraint.<br> ARMORS is still ongoing research. </p>
