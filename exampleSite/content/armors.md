    description: In 2020 spring semester, I wanted to apply my theoretical knowledge of control systems, I joined a graduate student, Nguyen Truong’s research – ARMORS, which stands for Automatic Response Man-Overboard Rescue System. Man-overboard scenarios are among the leading causes of death in deep sea fishing, one of United States’ most dangerous occupations. To improve rescue efficiency, ARMORS was introduced. ARMORS consists of unmanned lifeboat units (Smart Rafts) that automatically deploy and approach the fallen person and thus greatly reduces rescue time and enhance the worker’s survivability. The Smart Raft navigates to the fallen person and back to the main ship according to a control scheme, which is to be developed by Nguyen Truong. This control scheme specifies the necessary linear acceleration of the Smart Raft as any given time. The challenge is to translate the kinematics of the Smart Raft into the required kinematics of the Smart Raft’s propellers. I was assigned to develop a mathematical model that relates the kinetics of the propellers to the kinematics of the Smart Raft. This work was separate and distinct from the control scheme itself.
