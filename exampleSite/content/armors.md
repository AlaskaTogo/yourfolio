    description: In 2020 spring semester, I wanted to apply my theoretical knowledge of control systems, I joined a graduate student, Nguyen Truong’s research – ARMORS, which stands for Automatic Response Man-Overboard Rescue System. Man-overboard scenarios are among the leading causes of death in deep sea fishing, one of United States’ most dangerous occupations. To improve rescue efficiency, ARMORS was introduced. ARMORS consists of unmanned lifeboat units (Smart Rafts) that automatically deploy and approach the fallen person and thus greatly reduces rescue time and enhance the worker’s survivability. The Smart Raft navigates to the fallen person and back to the main ship according to a control scheme, which is to be developed by Nguyen Truong. This control scheme specifies the necessary linear acceleration of the Smart Raft as any given time. The challenge is to translate the kinematics of the Smart Raft into the required kinematics of the Smart Raft’s propellers. I was assigned to develop a mathematical model that relates the kinetics of the propellers to the kinematics of the Smart Raft. This work was separate and distinct from the control scheme itself.<br>When modeling a control system, it is essential to understand the mechanics of the system before setting up the control schematics. For this system, the focus is on the unmanned lifeboat’s geometry and environment condition it is in. The environment, for analysis purposes will be in in a calm water with no shear wind forces applied to the body of the lifeboat. Figure shown below is the design of the lifeboat via Solidworks by Nguyen Truong. Although it is not displayed in this figure – there will be two parallel propellers underneath the lifeboat to help navigate.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="oJBfnZ5"><a href="https://imgur.com/oJBfnZ5">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The following is a free body diagram of the smart raft.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="IgZlOBU"><a href="https://imgur.com/IgZlOBU">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>Learning outcome: Understanding after having tracking algorithm, breakdown the dynamics of the system, and then control the dynamics of the system to the path constraint.
