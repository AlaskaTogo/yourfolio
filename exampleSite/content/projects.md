  - name: Titan Rover
    description: I joined CSUF’s Titan Rover team in May of 2019. The team being a multidisciplinary group of students because of the necessary features of the rover and potentially having a chance to maybe learn from different majors’ specialty is what drew me into joining the team. Annually, CSUF Titan Rover participates in an international competition the University Rover Challenge located in Hanksville, Utah where universities all over the world come together to compete. Thankfully, I had the chance to compete in the 2019 competition before the covid-19 virus started circulating around the world. The experience I gained from the competition motivated me more to stay with this team. For my senior year, I assigned to the robotics sub-team, which focuses on the robotic arm and the end effector (gripper) of the rover. Initially the team decided to design a new gripper, after discussing the logistics of the tasks and time that were needed – came to terms to tune up the previous year teams’ end effector. My task was to improve the gripper that was used in the previous year team’s as well to design a system that can perform the necessary task. The task is to allow the rover to perform high precision tasks – type commands on a keyboard during the equipment servicing mission on a service lander and screw in/out a bolt. Although this task could be performed with the end effector, the risk of having an error is higher because the end effector cannot mimic a typing motion and the operator could accidently drop the Allen key tool while in use. The rotation of the end effector has not been fixed as well – eliminates that issue temporally for this task. Therefore, to mitigate having too many systems running through the robotic arm’s platform and making it easier for the controls sub-team to operate the rover – I came up with a general concept of designing the system shown below. ![Caption](\uploads\works\intg_designconcept.jpg) <span class="default-text bold-text">voluptatem voluptatum</span>,
