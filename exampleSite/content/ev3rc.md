    description: The challenge of this project was as a team design and program a vehicle that can automatically start and stop at or near the reference point indicated in the diagram (below) after turning it on to follow a curvilinear path.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="6P93sk0"><a href="https://imgur.com/6P93sk0">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The surface of the track was made from plywood that is raise ½” from the floor. The track Schematic is displayed in the following figure.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="t53D0Wy"><a href="https://imgur.com/t53D0Wy">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>Both squares are to simulate two buildings that the vehicle must avoid. Application of design concepts were kinematics, structural analysis, and vehicle dynamics.<br>The electrical hardware for this vehicle were the programmable EV3 Brick, medium servo motor, and large servo motor. The EV3 Brick serves as the control center and power station for the vehicle. Medium servo was used for the steering of the vehicle since precise steering was necessary. Large Servo was used at the power input for the gear box because it generated more power compared to the medium servo motor. A rubber tire was used because the material deforms better compared to other materials, giving more traction. Ideally, a tire without tread that gives more traction compared to a tire with tread and especially this was the most affordable option since it came with the kit.<br>For the wheel, the material was made from plastic other than it being the affordable option it was preferred choice than using a wheel that is made out metal even though it may have more structural integrity, but that would introduce more axial load.<br><p>The learning outcomes are from the design challenges the process of going through the stages of prototypes. The first prototype had a great turning radius but realized it would not work because of the axial loading on the center of the body, making the chassis bend due the weight from the EV3 Brick.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/4ja9dHU" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/a/4ja9dHU"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br> The second prototype’s chassis length was increased to distribute the weight from EV3 Brick but was too long causing a natural bend in the center of the body without any weight on it. The third prototype was a delta trike (two wheels in the back and one wheel in the front) seemed the answer for all but the chassis was too weak to handle the turns.</p><br>For production vehicle design as a team, we decided to go back to four-wheel vehicle and assembled a sturdier chassis – shrinking the chassis longitudinal length, stayed with a simple steering design with a pinion gear mated with a bigger gear perpendicular to each other, and using three links instead only two links for the axles to improve the yaw angle and able to withstand the loads exerted on the chassis. Functionality should come before the aesthetic or else you will not have a product.<br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0yO_Dswoeo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> rem ipsum.</p><p>Officia, aliquam?</p><p>Dicta, quia?</p><p>Aliquid, excepturi!</p>
