    description: This project's challenge was as a team design and program a vehicle that can automatically start and stop at or near the reference point indicated in the diagram (below) after turning it on to follow a curvilinear path.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="6P93sk0"><a href="https://imgur.com/6P93sk0">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>The surface of the track is plywood that is raised ½" from the floor. The track Schematic is displayed in the following figure.<br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="t53D0Wy"><a href="https://imgur.com/t53D0Wy">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>Both squares are to simulate two buildings that the vehicle must avoid. The application of design concepts was kinematics, structural analysis, and vehicle dynamics.<br>This vehicle's electrical hardware was the programmable EV3 Brick, medium servo motor, and large servo motor. The EV3 Brick serves as the control center and power station for the vehicle. A medium servo was used for the steering of the car since precise steering was necessary. Large Servo was used at the gear box's power input because it generated more power than the medium servo motor. Rubber tires were used because the material deforms better compared to other materials, giving more traction. Ideally, a tire without tread provides more traction than a tire with tread, and mostly this was the most affordable option since it came with the kit.<br><br>The wheel's material was chosen to be plastic, besides being the affordable option, it was a preferred choice than using a wheel made out of metal even though it may have more structural integrity, but that would introduce more axial load.<br><br><p>The learning outcomes are from the design challenges the process of going through the stages of prototypes. The first prototype had a great turning radius but realized it would not work because of the axial loading on the center of the body, making the chassis bend due to the EV3 Brick's weight.<br><br><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="wwEBXEP"><a href="https://imgur.com/wwEBXEP">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br> The second prototype's chassis length was increased to distribute the weight from EV3 Brick but was too long, causing a natural bend in the center of the body without any weight on it. The third prototype was a delta trike (two wheels in the back and one wheel in the front) seemed the answer for all, but the chassis was too weak to handle the turns.</p><br>For production vehicle design as a team, we decided to go back to a four-wheel vehicle and assembled a sturdier chassis – shrinking the chassis longitudinal length, stayed with a simple steering design with a pinion gear mated with a bigger gear perpendicular to each other, and using three links instead of only two links for the axles to improve the handling of the vehicle and being able to withstand the loads exerted on the chassis. The vehicle had staggered wheels where the rear wheels were bigger than the front wheels because the EV3 computer was positioned closely above the rear axle to prevent weight bias. Also, had Functionality should come before the aesthetic, or else you will not have a product.<br><br>Below is the video of the successful test.<br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0yO_Dswoeo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> The additional learning outcome is understanding power distribution. When there is not enough battery powering all the motors, it will not perform as great as the code is designed to be.</p>
